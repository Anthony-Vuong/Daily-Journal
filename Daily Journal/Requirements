Summary
This program will be used to keep track of daily thoughts, notes, and reminders that an user will input. Inspired by the
need to look back in time to find pertinent information that may have been forgotten. Serves to give user an opportunity
to record anything that they may find useful in the following weeks/months, but can't remember. This program will begin
as a simple write and display program using texting files and current workspace paths. Later down the road, a GUI will
be the forefront of the program allowing users to pull daily journal entries via a date specifier(calender). A database
may be introduced to allow a more organized and quicker accessible information.
